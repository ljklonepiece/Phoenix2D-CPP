  * Trainer automatic runs: a script interpreter is added to Trainer class.
    The syntaxis of the script is:
    - DO <int>: repeats <int> times the next commands until the corresponding
      END_DO
    - END_DO: closes the corresponding DO block.
    - WAIT <int>: the trainer does nothing for the next <int> cycles
    - CHANGE_TO <string>: changes the current play mode to <string> play mode
    - RECOVER: performs the (recover) command on the simulator
    
  * Added buffers to sense body data.  By default the buffer maximum size is
    8, and it can be accessed by Self::getStaminaAtTime(int time), where time
    is the offset in time.  For example, to access the stamina 2 cycles before
    the current cycle you must call Self::getStaminaAtTime(2);
