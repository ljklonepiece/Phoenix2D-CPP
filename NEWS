  * Trainer automatic runs: a script interpreter is added to Trainer class.
    The script must have the name trainer.phx and the next syntaxis:
    - DO <int>: repeats <int> times the next commands until the corresponding
      END_DO
    - END_DO: closes the corresponding DO block.
    - WAIT <int>: the trainer does nothing for the next <int> cycles
    - CHANGE_TO <string>: changes the current play mode to <string> play mode
    - RECOVER: performs the (recover) command on the simulator
    
  * Added buffers to sense body data.  By default the buffer maximum size is
    8, and it can be accessed by Self::getStaminaAtTime(int time), where time
    is the offset in time.  For example, to access the stamina 2 cycles before
    the current cycle you must call Self::getStaminaAtTime(2);
    
  * Added config class.  This class loads positions from the file config.phx.
    If the file does not exist, it loads the defaults positions from the class.
    
  * Each play mode now has a onMessageReceived(string,int) callback to process
    the messages received.  The first argument is the message and the second
    argument is the uniform number of the sender.  Currently it only implements
    the mate messages.
    
  * Added logging class through std::clog stream.  Example:
    std::clog << "Logging example" << std::endl; will log "Logging example"
    string to player_<int>.log file, where <int> is the player uniform number.
    This logging will only work if Config::LOGGING is set to true.
